I am passionate about understanding the **role of protein's flexibility** in
**life and disease**: *Protein flexibility* includes structural adaptation,
coordinated multi-domain motions, flexible linkers, disordered regions, and
fully disordered proteins. On the other hand, the *processes of life and
disease* include: cell signaling, catalysis, inhibition, activation,
coordination, condensation, and many others. Therefore, structural dynamics is
intrinsic and necessary to all biomolecules.

Below is a short description of my main research topics. Here, the most relevant
articles are highlighted but all my papers are listed in the
[publications](/publications) tab.

## Protein fuzzy binding in aberrant protein condensates in disease

**Structural dynamics** is vital for cellular processes; hence, protein
flexibility governs cell homeostasis in health and disease. In the last two
decades, researchers built the basis for understanding intrinsically disordered
proteins and we are now able to investigate protein condensation through the
lens of structural biology. Specifically, my research focuses on
understanding how **fuzzy binding** networks control and describe protein-protein interactions [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36416856/" >1</a>,
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkad214/7092913">2</a>],
protein liquid-liquid phase separation [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37017-7">3</a>], and how
single or multiple mutations result in aberrant condensation in disease.

## Modeling Intrinsically Disordered Proteins

With [Dr Julie Forman-Kay][jfk] and [Dr Teresa Head-Gordon][thg], we are
developing a software framework to model proteins with **high conformational
heterogeneity** using experimental data (NMR, SAXS, FRET, etc), Bayesian
approaches, A.I., and statistical sampling incorporating new and the state-of-the-art
knowledge in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).

We have developed a main software suite, **IDPConformerGenerator** [<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36030416/">1</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/julie-forman-kay-lab/IDPConformerGenerator">2</a>],
able to generate highly diverse conformers of peptide chains expected to be
disordered. Also, we proposed and implemented a Bayesian framework for ensemble
selection that accounts for uncertainties in experimental data [<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32775701/">3</a>]. Recently we have
leveraged machine learning methods to generate data-accurate ensembles of IDPs
and more accurate conformer models [<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12667">4</a>, <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749957/">5</a>, <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35213160/">6</a>].

## Fuzzy interactions regulating Src Family Kinases

At the [BioNMR][biu] group in Barcelona, in a highly synergistic group, **we described a
new regulatory mechanism for Src Family Kinases (SFK)**. SFK’s activity is
regulated by the contraction and expansion of their domains as controlled by
localized phosphorylations that render available or hide the active site.
Although SFKs have been studied for many decades, under the light of "fuzzy
binding" and using advanced NMR techniques, we found the N-terminal disordered
Unique Domain of SFK’s transfers signals from the cell membrane to the SFK
receptor **via a network of fuzzy interactions** with the folder SH3 domain.
Furthermore, the structural details of the Unique Domain fine-tune these fuzzy
networks. For example, we found the 21-residue deletion in SFK Lyn isoform B is
enough to change the regulatory behavior of this 512 residue protein. We
proposed that such a membrane-UD-SH3 mechanism is common to the SFK family. Find

SFK’s activity.

## Role of MMP linkers in collagenolysis

During my Ph.D., we described how the MMP's **flexible linker** orchestrates the
relative movements MMP's catalytic and hemopexin folded domains by poising them
favorable to cleave the triple helical collagen - a process necessary for the
metastatic progression of tumor cells
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.09.020" >1</a>, <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M113.477240" >2</a>].
My work was one of the first to combine several NMR techniques, crystallography,
and software from the [We-NMR][wenmr] consortium to solve a large biochemical
unknown and provide models for MMP-1 free, and collagen-bound, **in solution**. This
research was highlighted in the first issue of the [paraNMR FP-7
letters][paraNMR], you can download my Ph.D. thesis from [ResearchGate][phd]
where the MMP-1:Collagen models are presented. I am the author of the MMP-1
dedicated chapter in the Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, 2024.

## New mechanisms to combat antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistance by pathogenic bacteria is likely today’s top concern on
health security. Therefore, identifying alternative routes to destroy infectious
bacteria are crucial to develop future disease-control strategies. We
demonstrated that TomB antitoxin activity is oxygen dependent, and it actively
oxidizes the Hha toxin to reduce the latter’s activity through the oxidation of
a conserved cysteine residue [<a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13634">1</a>].

## Software engineering for biophysical sciences

Because of my continuous interest in software architecture and in sharpening
best practices in open-source software, I have led the development of (or
significantly contributed to) several software suites applied to biophysical
sciences.
{: .text-justify}

I highlight my contribution to the [HADDOCK3][hd3] project as a **lead
developer** from July 2021 to August 2022, when I brought the project from a
proof-of-concept to a [fully-featured beta version](hd3jmct). **HADDOCK** is the
largest biomolecular docking software in academia with thousands of active users
worldwide and is part of the - three-times European funded - [BioExcel][biox]
project. To engage and share with the community, I imparted
[talks](/software/#talks) on developing open-source software and program
architecture.

In the [software](/software) tab, you can find the list of software projects I
created, participate, and maintain. Of general interest, my [template
repository][pps] is configured with the latest best practices in software
development and distribution in Python. Find me also on [GitHub][jmctgit].

## Understanding COVID-19 infection through computational modeling

In the absence of experimental data, **computational modeling** allows us to have
prior knowledge of protein systems and complexes that can guide experimental
analysis and project design. Early on during the devastating COVID-19 pandemic,
together with colleagues worldwide, we investigated the cross-species
transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 [<a
href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008449">1</a>]
by modeling the ACE2 receptors of different domestic animal species with the
virus’ RBD protein, thus shedding light on the infections reported in farms and
zoos and helping predict possible cross-species transmission. Also, we generated
a data set of 242 modeled ACE2 human variants bound to the RDB protein [<a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00652-6">2</a>]. This data set
can boost the design of therapies against Sars-CoV-2 and coronavirus in general
by considering different world populations and is available openly <a
href="https://kastritislab.github.io/human-ace2-variants/">online</a>.
