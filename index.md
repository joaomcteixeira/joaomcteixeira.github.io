I am a structural biologist with a Ph.D. in Biophysics (2014). I dedicate my
career to investigating how the structural dynamics of proteins regulate health
and disease. I have a multidisciplinary background covering sample preparation,
data acquisition, and computational modeling of multidomain and intrinsically
disordered proteins and their complexes. Recently, I started focusing on
understanding how these flexible proteins drive and dictate the formation and
homeostasis of membrane-less organelles - a recently acknowledged form of
biomolecular condensates crucial for life. Finally, I am passionate about
software architecture, open-source practices, and efficient numerical
computations in Python. I was born in Portugal in 1986 and have worked in ten
different research centers in eight countries. Here you will find a summary of
my research and professional activities. Feel welcome to contact me.
