**Current:** I am a senior developer at [Zymvol Biomodeling](https://zymvol.com/).

**Background:** I am a specialist in computational structural biology with a Ph.D. in Biophysics (2014).
During my research career, I studied the structural dynamics of multidomain proteins
and intrinsically disordered proteins in solution by combining experimental work
and computational modeling. In the last eight years, I further specialized in
software engineering in Python, creating and developing several open-source modeling
software suites such as the NIH-funded IDPConformerGenerator and the BioExcel-funded HADDOCK3.
I have authored 33 scientific publications and one book chapter.
