I am a **computational structural biologist** with a Ph.D. in Biophysics (2014),
developing new methods **to model protein dynamics of multidomain and
intrinsically disordered proteins** in health and disease. I have vast
experience in **software engineering and high-performance numerical computations
in Python**, C.I. implementation, and best practices for scientific software
distribution.  Additionally, I have a **ten-year background in experimental
research of protein dynamics**, granting me a deep understanding of the domain
knowledge covering the methods I am developing.  I look forward to discussing
future projects with you; contact me!
